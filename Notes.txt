Basic Programming
-----------------

Variable : They are a way for us to store information that was can reference to.

Control Flow: They are a way to control what commands should go first or what commands should be repeated
			  or what commands can only execute if some condtion has been met
			  
If Statement: Used to run certain lines of code if a condition is met

Else if statement: run another condition if the first one failed
else statement: run if all conditions failed

Loops statements: run the condtion multiple times



Git Introduction
----------------
* It is Version Control System
  - Allows you to manage the changes/dev made in proects
  - More specifically is Distributed Version COntrol (DVCS)

* It records any changes made to a project and maintain its history that contains the statement
  of the project at a certain times

Git vs Github:
 * Git is the local repository and this is how you can add new changes to the repository 
   - Push(upload) the code into the cloud.
  
 * Github is the remote repository that stores your code online so it is available to everyone
 

Repository:
 * This is where your file/code gets stored
 * It will lso store all the history a file went through and all its changes
